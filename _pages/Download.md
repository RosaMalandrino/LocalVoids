## We encourage researchers from different fields in astronomy to make use of this catalog!


Our catalog provides voids with well-defined centers, shapes, and boundaries, making the catalog practical to use for all applications that need characterization of the density environment.This includes galaxy properties and their evolution, galaxy biasing, supernovae and their use for Hubble constant measurements, and high-energy astrophysics, such as black holes and AGN in voids.
